# Verbs

As mentioned, **Verbum** is constructed in strategic ways to allow for greater understanding of the language as early as possible. One way in which that is done is to classify Verbs by verb groups based on English verbs. Each verb group begins with a certain set of consonants so just by looking at the verb, it is clear what group it belongs to. This is helpful when remembering the definition of a verb.&nbsp;

## Phonology

The Phonology of verbs is [CVC( - w, r, y, s, h, j, v, z)]. This is true for all verbs. &nbsp;The restriction on phonology for the first consonant is shown in the table. The primary verbs and verb groups are as follows:

||||
|--- |--- |--- |
|**Verb**|**Verbum**|**Notes**|
|Do (Act)|dan||
|Be|ban||
|Go|gan||
|Say|san||
|Sense|fan|'s' is used so 'f' is for Feel|
|Know|kan||
|Have|han||
|Want|wan||
|Try|tan||
|See|lan|'s' is used so 'l' is for Look|
|Make|pan|'m' is reserved so 'p' for Produce|
|Use|van|last consonant available is 'v'|

Using a 3-letter limit for Verbs might seem limiting, but verbs use a series of derivative morphemes so the number of actual verbs that can be created within a verb group can reach the thousands. For example: using the verb to SEE (lan), if we add the verb derivative variation morpheme for ‘physical action’, rō- (**rōlan**) we get the verb to Look.
  
## Conjugation

Conjugation in **Verbum** is straight forward but uses a number of derivation morphemes that are applied to the verb in a certain order to express the full conjugation of a verb similar to the way English conjugates verbs.&nbsp; If a verb has no modification, it is in the Present Indicative form.&nbsp; The tables below show an example of Conjugation using the verb to See **(lan).**

## Additional Conjugational Morphemes
  
As described in the Language rules, the Imperative (**bī**-) means Let’s or adds an exclamation mark to the sentence to make it a command. So, **bīgan** means _Let’s Go!_ You can add the Temporal Tense (-nū) to get **bīgannū** which would mean _Go Now!_

A note about the verb modifier Can.&nbsp; Can is Potential but also Declarative. So to say I can Go, add the Potential and Declarative to the verb _to Go_: **bībōgan jū.**

## Verb Conjugation Structure

When constructing conjugated words there is a structure to how the morphemes are added to the root verb.&nbsp; The structure looks like this:

{Conjugation}[Exteriors][Interiors][Variations]**Verb Root**][Interiors][Exteriors]{Conjugation}

Remember, the verb has to take on its meaning first before conjugation can take effect. When looking at the Exterior Morphemes, it should be noted that Possessives are ALWAYS the first morpheme so that the possessive is applied to the entire conjugated word.

## Verb Variation Morphemes

Verbs have a special case of Interior morpheme called a Variation.&nbsp; They are always directly applied to the verb before any other morpheme.

||||
|--- |--- |--- |
|**Meaning**|**Morpheme**|**Example**|
|Physical Act|rō-|**rōlan** (Look)|
|Process Of|rā-|**rālan** (View)|
|Cause/Outcome Of|rū-|**rūlan** (Identify)|
|Judicious/Authoritive Use Of|rē-|**rēlan** (Witness)|

### Minor Morphemes
  
||||
|--- |--- |--- |
|**Meaning**|**Morpheme**|**Example**|
|Inclusive All|sā-|**sālan** (We All See)|
|Exclusive You|-sā|**lansā** (We Saw, You didn't)|
|Action Over Short Time|-dō|**rōlandō** (Glance)|
|Action Over Time|-dū|**rōlandū** (Stare)|
|Action Over Long Time|-dā|**rōlandā** (Watch)|
                              
## Conceptual Infixes

Although not as extensive as nouns infixes, verbs can use morphemes to help extend the library of verbs as explained above.&nbsp; Adverbial morphemes can be combined to make new meanings when the adverbial morpheme is used as a **PREFIX** instead of a suffix. For Example, if we take _to Kill_ (**bān**) and add the [_to Become or be in the State of Being_ (-**śē**), we could interpret this as _to Neutralize_ (**śēbān**). Also, the word would be used in the Verb location of the sentence suggesting this is to be interpreted as a verb with this meaning and not an adverb or adjective.
