# Abverbs & Adjectives

## Phonology

Adverb use a CVC phonology similar to verbs but can only have a leading consonant that uses M, N, Y and Z. Adjectives use the following phonology: CVCC.  Adjectives can use any leading consonant but cannot use ṯ (θ), ẗ (ð), ś (ʃ) and ć (tʃ) as the first letter or the two last consonants.

## Conceptual Morphemes

Both Nouns and Verbs are modified to create adverbial and adjective meanings using the following morphemes. In some cases, words are created by combining two conceptual infixes together. If they are different, then they just connect as suffixes in the proper order. For example: Alternative – _Alter_, _(n)ate_ [śī], _ive_ [śē].  However, if the two infixes are from the same infix category, then the (-**se**) morpheme is added to mean double or repeat twice. In almost all cases it is possible to tell the order of the infix by the root word.  Again, as an example, _Responsiveness_ really can’t be understood any other way than it is currently written.  [-ive] is the only infix that makes sense in the first order. Then, with [-ive], the only possible choice for the second order in [-ness].

### Syntax

Since **Verbum** is a VSO language, adverbs and adjectives are placed after the noun, object or verb. So, in English you would say, The _tiny clear ball_, in **Verbum** you would say, _ball clear tiny_.  You could also say, ball tiny clear because the descriptive adjectives don’t really affect one another. However, if the adjectives do impart a distinct meaning depending on their order, then they need to be placed after the noun, object verb in such a way to express the meaning intended to be understood in reverse order from English.
