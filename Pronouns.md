# Pronouns

The chart below covers the common pronouns. When looking at the Pronoun list you will notice the use of the Opposite morpheme when using the pronoun (**jū**) for I and me which becomes (**jūno**) referring to “if not ME, then YOU”, the opposite of me. Another special morpheme and the only one of its kind because if of its use, means the Self (-**tēr**). We also make use of the Plural (**sē**-) in Pronouns, and the possessive of a proper noun (**mē**-).

When it's necessary to differentiate between a man or woman in a specific type of role or action, much like the **-tēr** suffix to mean Self, we add the **-nōr** to mean in the Feminine. For example, words that have Man or Women in them use **mo** or **mono** (Businessman or Businesswoman). But if the word does not have a **mo** or **mono** portion and you need to identify the word as referring to a female, then we use **nōr**. Such as Teacher (**sōkumo**). To make it specifically Feminine it would be **sōkumonōr.**

## Gender

One note about gender in **Verbum** Pronouns; there are only singular, male, female, and plural pronouns. But considering the world we live in it should be mentioned that **Verbum** is designed to allows for new constructions using morphemes to create new meaning.&nbsp; So, with regard to all the gender possibilities, it is difficult to cover each one.&nbsp; But it is possible to create a general non-binary gender pronoun reference.&nbsp; They is plural and not appropriate to be used as a singular pronoun.&nbsp; However, there is a morpheme (**sī**-) that means singular. Therefore, you could refer to they (**jūkē**) in a _singular, non-binary_ form using **sījūkē**. Another option is to refer to a _bi_ designation of yourself. Within the Numbers section later you will see a morpheme called (**pō**-) in combination with a number. For _bi_ you would use the position reference (**pō**-) and the number 2 (**kā**) along with the first person _I/Me_ to create **pōkājū** meaning a _binary gendered person_.
